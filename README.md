# NumericalMethods
Differents codes to solve systems of linear and differential equations. Code are made in Python.
I always try not to use libraries to make it easier to run the program, but in some code
are implemented to plot functions. I recommend using Google Colab or Spyder with Anaconda to avoid problems.
